== Usage:
Source `fzf_browser.sh` and execute `fuzzybrowse`, or map it to an alias of your choosing.
The fuzzybrowse command prints whatever was selected to stdout, so the result can be used in any way, such as
`cd $(fuzzybrowse)` for a directory jumper, or `vim $(fuzzybrowse)` for editing.

== Key mappings:
* `Tab` - Toggle between file and dir mode.
* `Ctrl-o` - Go back in directory stack.
* `Enter` - Enter directory under cursor, or select file and exit, depending on active mode.
* `;` - Select dir under cursor, and exit.
* `:` - Select current dir, and exit.
* `,` - Go to parent directory
* ``` - Go into selected dir and switch to file list. Press ``` again to go back.
* `Ctrl-x` / `Ctrl-s` - Open bash, with $f set to current selection
* `Ctrl-c` - Abort
