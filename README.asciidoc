== Usage:
Source `fzf_browser.sh` and execute `fuzzybrowse`, or map it to an alias of your choosing.
The fuzzybrowse command prints whatever was selected to stdout, so the result can be used in any way, such as
`cd $(fuzzybrowse)` for a directory jumper, or `vim $(fuzzybrowse)` for editing.

== Configuration
See top of bash script for options/functions.

== Key mappings:
* `Enter` - If selection is directory, change to it. If it is a file, select it and exit. If multiple entries are selected, just exits(with the selections).
* `Tab` - Select multiple files/directories.
* `Ctrl-l` - Preview selection. By default launches 
* `Ctrl-q` - Toggle showing hidden files.
* `Ctrl-f` - Change to file-recursive mode and back. Lists all files recursively from current dir.
* `Ctrl-z` - (Currently only works if application `fasd` is available) Select recent directory and switch to it. 
* `#` / ``` - Go to parent directory
* `Ctrl-h` - Go to `$HOME`
* `Ctrl-x` / `Ctrl-s` - Open `$SHELL`, with `$e` containing current selection.
* `Ctrl-f` - Opens `$EDITOR` with selection.
* `Ctrl-c` - Abort
* `Ctrl-o` - Go backwards in directory stack.
* `Ctrl-u` - Go forward in directory stack.(Currently only supports one jump)
