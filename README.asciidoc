Fuzzy directory and file browser for the shell, built around fzf.

=== Usage:
* Source `fzf_browser.sh` and execute `fuzzybrowse`, or map it to an alias of your choosing.
* Use <Tab> to switch between directory mode and file mode.


=== Limitations:
* Currently file mode only lists editable files, and opens them with $EDITOR, and the list for ignored files is very ad-hoc.
* fuzzydir automatically `cd`s between each step, breaking `cd -` for going to previous dir.
